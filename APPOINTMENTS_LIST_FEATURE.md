# ✅ New Appointments List Page Added!

I've successfully created a new page that lists all currently booked appointments. Here's what's been implemented:

## 🚀 **New Features Added:**

### 1. **Appointments List Page** (`/appointments`)

- Shows all currently booked appointments from the database
- Displays patient name, date, time, and description
- Allows canceling appointments with confirmation
- Responsive design with clean card layout

### 2. **Enhanced Navigation**

- Navigation bar with toggle between Schedule and Appointments views
- Header adapts based on current page
- Easy switching between views

### 3. **New Backend Endpoint**

- `GET /api/appointments/booked` - Returns only booked appointments
- Optimized query for better performance
- Sorted by date and time

### 4. **Routing System**

- Added React Router for navigation between pages
- Two main routes:
  - `/` - Schedule (main booking page)
  - `/appointments` - Appointments list

## 📋 **How to Use:**

### **Navigate to Appointments List:**

1. On the main schedule page, click **"View Appointments"** button in the header
2. Or visit `http://localhost:5173/appointments` directly

### **View Booked Appointments:**

- See all appointments in chronological order
- Each card shows:
  - 👤 Patient name
  - 📅 Date (formatted nicely)
  - ⏰ Time
  - 📝 Description (if provided)

### **Cancel Appointments:**

- Click the red "Cancel" button on any appointment
- Appointment is immediately removed from database
- UI updates in real-time
- Toast notification confirms cancellation

### **Navigate Back:**

- Click **"Back to Schedule"** button to return to booking page
- Or click **"Schedule"** in the header

## 🗂️ **File Structure:**

```
src/
├── pages/
│   ├── SchedulePage.tsx        # Main booking schedule (moved from App.tsx)

└── App.tsx                     # New routing setup
```

## 🔧 **Backend Changes:**

```javascript
// New endpoint in appointments.js
GET / api / appointments / booked;
// Returns: [{ id, time, date, isBooked, patientName, description }]
```

## 🎯 **Features:**

## 🧪 **Test the New Feature:**

   npm run docker:dev  # or npm run dev
   ```

2. **Book some appointments** on the main schedule

3. **Click "View Appointments"** in the header

4. **See your booked appointments** displayed in the list

5. **Try canceling** an appointment to test the functionality

## 🎨 **UI Features:**
